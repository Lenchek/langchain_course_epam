# Stage 4: Orchestrating All Components via LangGraph

Tasks:
Implement orchestration of all components using LangGraph.
Ensure complete integration of all stages:
The chatbot (RAG agent) interacts with users.
The system escalates reservation requests to the administrator via a human-in-the-loop agent (second agent).
The MCP server processes data after confirmation.

Implement the workflow logic for the entire pipeline:
Example graph structure:
Node for user interaction (context of RAG and chatbot).
Node for administrator approval.
Node for data recording.


Conduct testing of the entire system workflow.

Outcome:
A unified system where all components seamlessly interact with each other.
Stable operation of the entire pipeline.

Additional Details:
System Testing:
Conduct load tests to evaluate the performance of each component:
Chatbot in interactive dialogue mode.
Administrator confirmation functionality.
MCP server recording and storage process.

Perform integration testing of all steps during orchestration.

Documentation:
Prepare documentation for system usage:
Architecture description.
Agent and server logic.
Setup and deployment guidelines.


Providing the result: 
please provide a link to your GitHub or EPAM GitLab repository in the answer field
you can earn extra points if you provide the following artifacts: 
a PowerPoint presentation explaining how the solution works, including relevant screenshots
a README file with clear project documentation (setup, usage, structure, etc.)
Automated test cases are implemented using pytest or unittest  (at least 2 tests per module)
CI/CD automation and/or Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform)

if the code is poor quality, or too basic to be practical, and includes critical errors, the grade may be reduced
