# Stage 2: Implementation of Human-in-the-Loop Agent

Tasks:
Create the second agent using LangChain to interact with the administrator.
Chat bot should be able to send a reservation request to administrator and get confirm/refuse response from him.  (e.g. via email server, messenger, rest api ).
Organize the integration with the first agent so that the reservation request is escalated to the human administrator after collecting details from the user.

Key Features:
Generating and sending reservation confirmation requests to the administrator.
Receiving responses from the administrator.
Maintaining communication between the first and second agents.

Outcome:
Automated system that connects an administrator for reservation approval.

Providing the result: 
please provide a link to your GitHub or EPAM GitLab repository in the answer field
you can earn extra points if you provide the following artifacts: 
a PowerPoint presentation explaining how the solution works, including relevant screenshots
a README file with clear project documentation (setup, usage, structure, etc.)
Automated test cases are implemented using pytest or unittest  (at least 2 tests per module)
CI/CD automation and/or Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform)

if the code is poor quality, or too basic to be practical, and includes critical errors, the grade may be reduced
